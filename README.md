# nebula-md

**nebula-md** is the planning hub for [Nebula](https://github.com/cruglet/nebula) — a wii modding utility that I am working on.

This repository is essentially a **digital planbook** for the nebula project, managed entirely through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the **Git community plugin**. Documentation, feature planning, bug tracking, and general development thoughts live here in markdown format.

## Structure

For this repository, this `main` branch is **not used**. Instead, planning is organized into **separate branches**, each focusing on a different aspect of development. Current branches include:

- `todo-bugfixes`: Bug tracking and prioritization
- `todo-rework`: Reworking current systems to fit Nebula's design more
- `todo-features`: Feature ideas & scoped planning

Each branch has its own folder and note structure, tailored to its independent purpose. This way, different aspects of the project are much easier to track and plan for.

This repo isn’t for code, it’s for notes and ideas. If you're interested in what the planning process looks like or want to contribute on the conceptual level, this is the place.
