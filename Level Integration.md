 - [[Level Game Dir Prompt]]
	 - Make a prompt for the user to open a level from extracted game dir instead of instantiating a scene directly.
- [[Load Level Into Memory]]
	- Have the level be read and translated into a format that can be read by the engine and loaded into memory
- [[Tileset Texture Loading]]
- [[Sprite Texture Loading]]
- [[Object Texture Loading]] 
	Actual textures can come later, but the loading system is what actually needs to be implemented
